Vector Victor!

Implement various vector and matrix math functions without using third-party math libraries and loops.

Objectives
After completing this assignment, you will...

Understand list comprehensions.
Understand introductory linear algebra concepts.
Be able to perform mathematical operations on complex list structures.
Deliverables
A Git repo named vector-victor containing at least:
A README.md file explaining how to run your project.
A linear_algebra.py module with your implementation.
A linear_algebra_tests.py file containing unit tests.
Normal Mode


Implement these linear algebra functions:

vector shape in shape()
vector addition in vector_add()
vector subtraction in vector_sub()
vector sum in vector_sum()
dot product in dot()
vector multiplication by a scalar in vector_multiply()
mean of multiple vectors in vector_mean()
magnitude in magnitude()
These functions are all defined in the Vector & Matrix Formulas notebook included with this assignment as well as the linear algebra unit tests.

Requirements
All unit tests must pass.
No use of for or while loops - only comprehensions.
No use of third-party libraries - only built-in + - / * math operators, built-in functions, and the math module.
However, it is entirely possible to do this without the math module.
